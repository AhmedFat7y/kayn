**This will still be usable to a degree -- the [wiki](https://github.com/ChauTNguyen/kindred-api) still exists for anyone who needs it.**

This project started out as a way to learn how to make a basic library, but also to experiment with using objects as parameters. I thought it'd be cool if I could make a single request method work with different type of parameters, and so I set out to make this library. It actually gained a nice amount of users (probably because I was designing it for other noobs like me at the time, and I also made it while other libraries weren't being updated), and gave me a lot of new opportunities (interviews with top companies).

However, as time went by, it became harder to work with my (bad) code (it's tightly-coupled, it's messy, and the core is one jumbo file that I'm too lazy to clean up). On top of that, all the API / rate limit changes, my job, studying for interviews, personal matters, and my declining "health" (kerataconus) really made it hard to work on this. I found it difficult to test every aspect of the library, and eventually I grew tired of it.

To be honest, I'm just taking a few months off my League-related projects (kindred-api being one of them). However, by the time I'm back, the other libraries should be even better than they are now, so there's no point in using this as I'll be behind.
